<title>Stoves and Ovens got that Heat</title>

<h1 class="ted"><i>Stoves and Ovens got that Heat</i></h1>

<h2 class="ted">Did you know stoves and ovens got that <em>heat?</em> </h2>

<h3 Id="martin"<h3>Did you know stoves and ovens got different ways of cooking food?</h3>

<p>Well, I think you don't cause you're a <strong>fool</strong>. Well, I'm going to inform you on the differen't ways you can cook with the variety a stove/oven has to offer to take control of that heat.</p>

<h2 class="ted"<h2>Pan top heat!</h2>

<p>This all is about that <b>top console</b>. You know those coily things that may be outside or inside the top console? Well, that's the stove(part of it). You know those nobs on the top, lets call those the controllers of the heat for the stove. So, they have numbers either on them or around them. The knob has a pointer to indicate what number your on. That number stands for the tempature of the heat that is going to be applied to whatchu cooking. To turn on the heat source, the stove/oven I have at home you just push that sucker in and put the pointer on the tempature you are trying to cook with(your stove may work different, I don't know. If so, look at the manual).

<h2 id="martin"h2>You tryna get baked?</h2>

<p>Now, this is where everything begins to get deep and personal. You really get in side the stove/oven with this one. This is where you have your unbaked food sit in a food sana to get real baked up and hot and ready to consume. <b><blockquote>So, how do we go about this? I knew you was a fool!</blockquote></b> Well, don't worry. I'm going to tell you. I gotchu homie/sista. So, on my oven (I don't know about yours,but you know that <ins>manual)</ins>where the knobs are, inbetween those knobs is the control panel for the oven, might have some other stuff to it but yeah. So, you should have a option on that control panel that says <mark>"Bake"</mark> hit that dude righ there. Once, you have done did that. There should come up some numbers and a F for fahrenheit. Now, choose the tempature you would like to bake that food up with and hit that start button and WALA, you did it.

<h2 class="ted"<h2> Time to Broli my Boyo </h2>

<p> With broiling, were still riding with the oven, still in the inside of everything but we getting a bit more deeper. Things get a bit more <i>HOT</i> here. Broiling is different then baking, I'm not kidding you when I say it gets <em>HOT</em>. This is where you put your goods right up on that top rack and cook your food at a high tempature. On the control panel in between the knobs there should be a button that says <mark>"Broil"</mark>. Hit that mans up and select the tempture you're trying to cook with. You should be set, just watch your good good cook. </p>

<! hey Mr. Chad, I know you're looking at this. It's random. I hope you find some enjoyment in it, maybe a laugh and yeah.>
